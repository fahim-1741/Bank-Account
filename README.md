# Bank-Account
Bank-AccountThis Java program demonstrates the core concept of encapsulation in object-oriented programming (OOP). The BankAccount class enforces data protection by keeping all account information private and providing controlled access through dedicated getter and setter methods.The program's primary goal is to ensure data integrity by validating input, preventing invalid operations such as setting a negative balance.Key Features and PrinciplesThe design of the BankAccount class adheres to the principles of encapsulation:Data Protection: Uses private data fields to protect sensitive account information.Safe Reading: Provides getter methods to safely read account data from outside the class.Controlled Updates: Uses setter methods with validation logic to safely update the balance.Access Control: Prevents direct, uncontrolled access to private account variables.OOP Design: Demonstrates a clean and simple object-oriented approach.Program Execution SummaryThe demonstration illustrates the encapsulation benefits through the following steps:Three distinct bank account objects are initialized.Balances are updated using the validated setter methods.Any attempts to update the balance with a negative value are rejected, and an informative error message is displayed.Account details (such as the final balance) are successfully displayed using the getter methods.The successful enforcement of restricted access and data validation explicitly proves the use of encapsulation.
