# Bank-Account
This Java program demonstrates the concept of encapsulation in object-oriented programming.
The BankAccount class keeps all account information private and allows controlled access using getter and setter methods.The program ensures that invalid data, such as a negative balance, is not accepted.

Uses private data fields to protect account information

Provides getter methods to safely read data

Uses setter methods with validation to update balance

Prevents direct access to account variables

Demonstrates clean and simple object-oriented design

Three bank account objects are created.

Balances are updated using setter methods.

Negative balance updates are rejected with an error message.

Account details are displayed using getter methods.

Direct access to private variables is not allowed, proving encapsulation.
